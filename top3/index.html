  <img src="https://quattromani.github.io/centennial-corp-display/images/properties/foxvalleymall/FoxValley_6A7587.jpg"
    class="center">
  <p>this is my favorite place because it has the Sound Voltex Valkyrie Model as well as Dancerush Stardom and i love
    playing those games very much and the staff is also really nice</p>
  <h2>2. Round 1 North Riverside Park Mall</h2>
  <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DyAxzvRU8AAl7_j.jpg" height="500px" width="750px" class="center">
  <p>this is my Second favorite place because it has Sound Voltex Valkyrie Model on one credit premium time which is
    really cheap as well as Dancerush Stardom but i rarely ever go there because my parents don't like the area it's in
    sad emoji</p>
  <h3>3. Round 1 Southridge Mall</h3>
  <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DyqmwNiV4AA2OSw.jpg" height="500px" width="750px" class="center">
  <p>this is my third favorite place ever because it has a livestreaming setup for the Sound Voltex Valkyrie Model and
    you can stream off it <a href="https://twitch.tv/BemaniSRM">link here</a> only issue is the round 1 has no dancerush
    stardom and its also in milwaukee which is like 90 mins away (very far) so i've only been once</p>
  <p>thank you <b>so much</b> <i>for viewing</i> my really cool list</p>
